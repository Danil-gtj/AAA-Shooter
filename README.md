# FPS-Shooter
Creating a first-person shooter in UE5 in C++.

I tried to write a huge number of mechanics and connect them with each other. A lot of work was done, during which I learned to write code and understand the Unreal API. I used publicly available materials on the Internet and tried to write some things myself, for example, capture the flag mechanics, team selection and some other things. A lot more could be written and optimized, but such work would take a lot of time. I learned a lot of new things and understood what to do and what not to do. This is a very good experience ;).
